A work-in-progress wayland compositor build for [Fibreglass](https://github.com/dealerofallthecats/fibreglass), made with [Louvre](https://github.com/CuarzoSoftware/Louvre/).

Planned features:
- Custom shaders for window rendering achieved by using [Kay](https://github.com/CuarzoSoftware/Kay)
- Customizable window borders/decoration
- Dynamic configuration achieved by using dbus protocols (compiled into a wrapper program for ease-of-use)
- Custom tiling definition
